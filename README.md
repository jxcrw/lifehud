## Why?
Initially popularized by version control sites like Github and Gitlab, "contribution graphs" (congraphs) have a number of features that make them a deceptively powerful tool for visualizing past progress and motivating future progress on long-term life projects.

- Deeply intuitive view of project activity over an entire year or an entire lifetime.
- Bad past performance is painfully obvious and motivates better future performance.
- Good past performance creates visual chains that motivate continued good performance.
- Collecting green dots is easier, more rewarding, and less existentially threatening than "working hard".
- Achieving mastery of a skill/project becomes trivial - just fill up all the dots for several years in a row. ðŸ˜Ž
